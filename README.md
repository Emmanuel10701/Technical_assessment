# **AI Chat System of backend (Full Stack Application)**

## **Overview ðŸŒŸ**

This is a full-stack AI chat application where users can register, log in, and interact with a chatbot. Users receive responses based on their queries and tokens are deducted from their account for each message they send. The system is built using **Django** for the backend, **Next.js** for the frontend, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

While this application currently provides core functionality, **future improvements** could include integrating a **Neural Network** for more intelligent responses and applying **DevOps practices** for better deployment and scalability.

---

## **Technologies Used ðŸ’»**

- **Backend Framework**: Django (RESTful API for managing users, chats, and tokens).
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js (dynamic UI with Tailwind CSS).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (for modern, responsive design).
- **Database**: SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure login and session management.
- **Containerization**: Docker for containerizing the application.
- **Cloud Deployment**: (Suggested for future use) Deployment on **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **Azure**.

---

## **Core Features ðŸš€**

- **User Registration & Login**: Users can sign up, log in, and maintain an account.
- **Token Management**: Each user starts with 4000 tokens, and tokens are deducted for every message sent.
- **Chat Interface**: The chatbot generates responses to user input, with token deductions.
- **Token Balance Check**: Users can view their remaining token balance.

---

## **How It Works ðŸ› **

### **1. User Registration API**  
- Users can register with a unique username and password. Upon successful registration, the user is assigned 4000 tokens.

### **2. User Login API**  
- Users log in with their username and password, receiving an authentication token for subsequent requests.

### **3. Chat API**  
- The AI chatbot receives user messages, generates responses, and deducts 100 tokens for each question asked.

### **4. Token Balance API**  
- Users can check their remaining tokens via this API endpoint.

## **Setup and Installation ðŸ’¾**

### **Backend Setup (Django)**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AI-Chat-System.git
   cd AI-Chat-System

# Project Setup Guide

## Backend Setup (Django)

1. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/Scripts/activate  # On mac: venv\\bin\\activate
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up the database:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

4. **Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):**

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

5. **Run the server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Frontend Setup (Next.js)

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```bash
    npm create@nextlatest frontend
     cd frontend

    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the frontend development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Future Suggestions ðŸš€

While the application currently offers the core features, there are opportunities for enhancement, including:

### Neural Network Integration for AI Chatbot

- **Technologies**: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow
- **Objective**: Integrate a neural network model to improve the chatbot's ability to provide intelligent and context-aware responses.
- **Training the Model**: By feeding high-quality datasets into the model, the AI will become smarter over time, offering more accurate answers.

### DevOps Practices

- **Containerization with Docker**: The application can be containerized using Docker to ensure it works seamlessly across different environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate testing, building, and deployment with tools like GitLab, Jenkins, or Azure DevOps to streamline updates.
- **Cloud Deployment & Scaling**: The application can be deployed to the cloud (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) with tools like Kubernetes for auto-scaling based on traffic.

## Conclusion ðŸŽ¯

This AI Chat System provides a foundation for building intelligent chatbots and integrates modern technologies for scalable deployment. It offers a user-friendly experience with secure authentication and real-time token management. The suggested future improvements, such as neural network integration and DevOps practices, will significantly enhance the system's capabilities, making it more efficient and scalable.
